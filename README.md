What is it
----------

ForgeDebugger is a graphical front-end and source-level debugger for the Leonie runtime.


How to build
------------

To build the ForgeDebugger, check out the ULINetSocket repository into the same folder as ForgeDebugger, and build the ForgeDebugger Xcode project.


How to use
----------

Simply launch the ForgeDebugger application. It will start listening on a hard-coded port for connections. Then run some Leonie code, and make sure it initializes the debugger with the IP address of the Mac on which ForgeDebugger is running. It will then connect to the debugger and you will be able to debug your code, on both a source and bytecode level.
